		<p>Birds are very intriguing creatures as they can range from birds 
		as small as a Cuban bee hummingbird (about two inches long and a 
		little over 1/20 of an ounce) to as large as an ostrich. While most 
		birds fly, there are some that don't. Birds are amazing and each 
		breed is unique in its own way, particularly when it comes to their 
		relational needs and well-being. Unfortunately, birds can experience
		sadness and depression just like humans. A number of root causes 
		may be responsible for your bird's depression such as an illness 
		(either physical or mental), losing its companion, or increasingly 
		becoming bored. Some signs to help identify if your bird is experiencing
		depression may include the following:</p>
		<ul class="LinkList">
			<li>reduced appetite</li>
			<li>becoming increasingly irritable</li>
			<li>aggressive behavior</li>
			<li>songs have a different, more solemn tone</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Be sure to tell your veterinarian if you see signs of any of these 
		symptoms. Just like many illnesses, identifying and treating the 
		symptoms earlier may drastically increase the lifespan of your birdie.</p>

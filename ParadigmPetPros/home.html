		<p>Pets are nature's gift to humanity. It has been 
		scientifically proven that opening our homes and hearts 
		to a pet increases our longevity and improves our overall
		quality of life as well as the lives of our pets. At Pet 
		Paradigm Professionals, our mission is to offer resources 
		to help you care for your furry, scaly, feathery, and slimy 
		loved ones. Our pet experts—or “Pexperts”—have been working 
		with pet owners and professionals alike for the past twelve 
		years. They offer one-on-one consultations with current and

		<p>Cats were first domesticated around 7500 BCE in the western Asia 
		region and are currently the second most popular domestic pet in the
		United States. While there are over 60 unique documented cat breeds,
		care and diet can differ between breeds. However, some diets and 
		practices are generally recommended for the well-being of your fluffy 
		family member regardless of breed.</p>

		<h2>Zero to Four Weeks</h2>
		<p>It is important the queen (a term commonly used for a female cat that 
		is either pregnant or nursing) directly nurse her young if possible. 
		Monitor your kittenâ€™s growth closely to make sure its growth rate is 
		progressing steadily. If any kitten is not growing at a sufficient rate, 
		a caretaker might need to feed the kitten directly either with a bottle
		or a feeding tube. Some reasons why kittens might not gain weight appropriately
		include the following:</p>
		<ul class="LinkList">
			<li>too many other siblings are competing for mom's milk</li>
			<li>gastrointestinal disease</li>
			<li>environmental conditions such as extreme heat or cold, or unsanitary conditions</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Four Weeks to One Year</h2>
		<p>Kittens can start being introduced to soft wet kitten food typically 
		around three to four weeks after birth. According to the 
		<a href="https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/cat-care/cat-nutrition-tips">ASPCA</a>, 
		kittens at this age should eat half to one cup of dry kitten food or six to nine 
		ounces of wet kitten food per day. If your kitten has difficulties eating 
		hard food, a small amount of water can be added to soften the food. Cat 
		food that is optimized for kittens provides the additional nutrients that 
		are needed for growth, energy, and wellness. Depending on the breed, your 
		cat may have different dietary requirements. You should always consult 
		with your veterinarian for recommendations.</p>

		<h2>One Year to Seven Years</h2>
		<p>This age is when kittens reach the cat stage and do not need as many 
		nutrients. At this age, their level of activity decreases, and so does 
		their metabolism. It is not recommended to leave food out for the cats 
		all day. Instead, provide food a couple times a day so they eat meals 
		rather than snacking throughout the day. This practice reduces the risk 
		of obesity and other weight-related feline ailments.</p>
		<h2>Seven Years and More</h2>
		<p>Much like many living organisms, the body begins to deteriorate and 
		experience a lot of changes. Cats at this age should eat less fats and 
		calories and more quality proteins. This means when you are purchasing 
		packaged foods for your cat, look for food that states a particular 
		protein (such as "salmon") and not just a category (such as fish). 
		This usually means they are byproducts, or combinations, of lesser 
		quality proteins.</p>
